# BitcoinDataAnalysis
This is my final project for DTSA 5511, which explores the history of Bitcoin from 2014-2022 in regard to the price, number of transactions, traded Bitcoin over time, mining profitability, and using an LTSM model to predict Bitcoins price. I hope you enjoy viewing the analysis!
